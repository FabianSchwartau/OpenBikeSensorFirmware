In case you might get a OpenBikeSensor, you should do some first steps.

1. Check, if your handlebar fits the OpenBikeSensor's display/button holder.  
There are basically two different kinds of handlebars: thinner ones, with a 25,4mm diameter and the other ones, with a 31.8mm diameter. You might create some kind of adapter, if the device is designed for 31,8mm and you have a 25,4mm handlebar, but the other way around is not possible
2. Measure the distance between the outer edge of the device and the end of your handlebar. Enter these values into the configuration options.
3. Set your privacy zone(s). You could probably get the GPS location with any digital map app. Enter these values into the configuration options.
4. Check the SD card, if it's ok and - in best case - empty.
5. Load the device's battery.
6. Put it on the bike and go for a ride. Please take care about traffic around you and don't let the OpenBikeSensor distract you!
